# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Model

A machine learning web application that predicts whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** based on user input. 
The app is built using **Streamlit** and uses **Logistic Regression** as the classification algorithm.

## About the Project

- Uses the **Breast Cancer dataset** from `sklearn.datasets`
- Trained using **Logistic Regression**
- Model is saved and loaded using **joblib**
- Deployed via **Streamlit**
- User inputs 30 features to get prediction

## Model Performance

- **Training Accuracy**: 94%
- **Testing Accuracy**: 92%
- **Overall Score**: 94.55%
